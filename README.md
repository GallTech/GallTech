## Microsoft 365 & SharePoint Administrator & SPFX Framework Developer | PowerShell

With 25+ years in SharePoint consulting & administration, Iâ€™ve built enterprise-scale intranets and developed solutions that empower businesses. 

SharePoint on-prem & online experience with extensive PowerShell automation.
Designing & optimizing M365 solutions, balancing governance, security & usability.
Architecting scalable, high-performance intranet & digital workplace solutions.

I'm interested in PowerShell, SharePoint, M365, SQL Server, Azure, Azure DevOps, Python, AI and lots more. 

I focus on the automated management of Microsoft 365 and SharePoint. 

### Recent projects include:

- Automated deployment, configuration and management of M365 Purview Risk and Compliance.
- Fully automated end-to-end deployment of Azure DevOps Repository for PowerShell modules. This clones to a local Git repository and uses Plaster to deploy module scaffolding.
