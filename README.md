# Mike Gallagher
## _Senior Operations Engineer with over 20 years SharePoint experience_

Iâ€™m passionate about SharePoint, SQL Server, M365, Azure, PowerShell, C#, and lots more. I really enjoy automating all aspects of SharePoint and M365.

## Some recent highlights:

- M365 Purview Risk and Compliance deployment and management module
- Fully automated end-to-end creation of Azure DevOps Repository and cloning to local Git repository using Plaster to deploy module templates
- SharePoint on-premises Migration module, built using the ShareGate PowerShell Module and PnP
- Function to identify SP on-premises site collections approaching their quota limit
