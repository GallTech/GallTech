# Mike Gallagher  
## Microsoft 365 & SharePoint Administration | PowerShell Automation  

As a former Senior Premier Field Engineer at Microsoft and a SharePoint consultant with over 25 years of experience, I‚Äôve helped organizations design and implement enterprise-scale intranets and information management systems. My work spans both information architecture‚Äîstructuring content through metadata, taxonomy, and governance‚Äîand systems architecture, including infrastructure design, automation, and deployment at scale.

In addition to deep experience with on-premises environments, I work extensively with Microsoft 365 and SharePoint Online‚Äîautomating deployments, managing content lifecycles, and supporting hybrid environments to simplify operations and ensure long-term maintainability.

Specialising in:
- SharePoint (on-prem & online) with deep PowerShell automation
- Designing and optimising Microsoft 365 solutions with governance, security, and usability in balance
- Architecting scalable, high-performance intranet and digital workplace solutions

I‚Äôm passionate about PowerShell, SharePoint, Microsoft 365, SQL Server, Azure, Azure DevOps, Python, AI‚Äîand much more.

My primary focus is the **automated management of Microsoft 365 and SharePoint**.

In my spare time, I build digital tools to support my research in **Early Modern European History**.
