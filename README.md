## _Senior Operations Engineer. Over 20 years SharePoint experience_

I’m interested in SharePoint, SQL Server, M365, Azure, PowerShell, C#, and lots more! I really enjoy automating all aspects of SharePoint (all versions) and M365.

## Some recent highlights:

- Fully automated deployment and management of M365 Purview Risk and Compliance
- End-to-end creation of Azure DevOps Repository and cloning to local VS Code repository
