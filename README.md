# Mike Gallagher
## _Senior Operations Engineer with over 20 years SharePoint experience_

Iâ€™m passionate about SharePoint, SQL Server, M365, Azure, PowerShell (:heart_eyes:), C#, and lots more! I really enjoy automating all aspects of SharePoint and M365.

## Some recent highlights:

- Fully automated deployment and management of M365 Purview Risk and Compliance
- End-to-end creation of Azure DevOps Repository and cloning to local VS Code repository
- SharePoint on-premises Migration module, building using the ShareGate PowerShell Module and PnP
