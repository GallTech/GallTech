# Mike Gallagher
## Senior Operations Engineer with over 20 years SharePoint experience

My focus is on about PowerShell, SharePoint, M365, SQL Server, Azure, C#, and lots more. I really enjoy managing and automating all aspects of SharePoint and M365. I like automation. 

### Recent automation projects include:

- SharePoint Online Site Provisioning Module. This was built on the PnP Provisioning Engine. Deploy and manage sites, pages, lists, views, content types, properties, etc. 
- Deployment and management of M365 Purview Risk and Compliance.
- Fully automated end-to-end deployment of Azure DevOps Repository and cloning to local Git repository using Plaster to deploy module templates.
- SharePoint on-premises migration module, built using the ShareGate PowerShell Module and PnP.
- PowerShell Module to identify SP on-premises site collections approaching their quota limit.
