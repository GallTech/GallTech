# Mike Gallagher
## Senior Operations Engineer with over 20 years SharePoint experience

I'm interested in PowerShell, SharePoint, M365, SQL Server, Azure, C#, Azure DevOps and lots more. 
I enjoy automating and managing all aspects of Microsoft 365 and SharePoint. 

### Recent projects include:

- SharePoint Online Site Provisioning Module. This was built on the PnP Provisioning Engine. Deploy and manage sites, pages, lists, views, content types, properties, etc. 
- Automated deployment, configuration and management of M365 Purview Risk and Compliance.
- Fully automated end-to-end deployment of Azure DevOps Repository for PowerShell modules. This clones to a local Git repository and uses Plaster to deploy module scaffolding.
- SharePoint online migration module, built using the ShareGate PowerShell Module and PnP.
- PowerShell Module to identify SP on-premises site collections approaching their quota limit.
